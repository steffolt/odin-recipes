    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 onions</li>
        <li>3 carrots</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>2 kg  pre-cooked tripe</li>
        <li>1 celery</li>
        <li>1 kg beef bones</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>2 parsley roots</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>500 gr cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Into a large pot, put 4.5 liters (19 cups) of water and bring to the boil.</li>
        <li>When the water reaches boiling point, add the beef bones. Leave to boil for about an hour on a low heat, removing the froth whenever necessary.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, wash and clean the vegetables, cut into quarters and add to the soup to boil along with the bones.</li>
        <li>When the soup beings to boil again, add the finely chopped, pre-cooked tripe. </li>
        <li>Now add a few bay leaves and peppercorns and let everything simmer on a low heat for another hour or so until the meat is very well cooked.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat, remove the bones, and use a strainer to remove the belly and boiled vegetables. Pass the remaining soup through a sieve several times to keep it perfectly clear.</li>
        <li>Choose a few pieces of the boiled vegetables to return to the soup along with the finely chopped belly.</li>
        <li>Take the meat from the boiled bones, cut it into cubes and add to the soup.</li>
        <li>Puree the rest of the cooked vegetables in a blender and add to the soup.</li>
        <li>The final step in making the perfect tripe soup recipe is as follows:</li>
        <li>Break the four eggs into a bowl and mix with the cream.</li>
        <li>Add a bit of hot soup to them, stirring all the while so lumps do not form.</li>
        <li>When the mixture has obtained the desired consistency, pour everything into the soup and mix quickly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
       Mamaliga is the Romanian version of this staple and has been called the country's
       national dish. While the recipe itself is not revolutionary, the history behind mamaliga is fascinating. 
       Cooked in a round-bottomed kettle called a "ceaun," the cornmeal porridge would be turned out into the 
       center of the peasantry's wooden farm tables, where it hardened as it cooled, holding its rounded shape.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1-2/3 cups yellow cornmeal, medium grind</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring water to boil in a medium saucepan.</li> 
        <li>Add salt and butter.</li>
        <li>Begin stirring the water in one direction, sprinkling about 1/3 cup of the cornmeal into the depression that forms in the center.</li> 
        <li>Once the water returns to the boil, pour in the rest of the cornmeal, stirring continuously to prevent clumps from forming.</li> 
        <li>Turn heat to low and continue stirring until cornmeal begins to thicken.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and cook on low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 10 to 15 minutes.</li> 
        <li>When it is done, the mamaliga will pull away from the sides of the pot.</li>
        <li>Invert the pan onto a wooden cutting board and carefully lift it away â€” the mamaliga should hold its shape, spreading out slightly.</li> 
        <li>Slice into six wedges and top with butter and sour cream.</li>
    </ol>
